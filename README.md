# MAT 301-AI

This was a project undertaken for a third year class. The aim was to compare two ai techniques, this project compares a fuzzy inference system vs a finite state machine in controlling a cars movement.

## The application
The application is built using SFML to render the application and provide input. It also takes advantage of a the FuzzyLite c++ library to perform the fuzzy logic inference.
